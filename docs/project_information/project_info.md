This project is the implementation of a UK-based Business Listings Directory website
The template we are building will serve various niches, but we are starting with Fish and Chip shops
The goal is to become the Go-To destination for anyone with an interest in this niche 
We are setting out to build a super-sleek, modern, world-class, ultra-performant, and highly SEO optimised website.

We will be primarily using the Astro framework (https://docs.astro.build/)
Core content will be provided in the form of multiple JSON files, each containing multiple business listings (typically one file per town). Examples are provided in data/listing/*.json

The source data is primarily drawn from Goggle Places (New) API, but will be enriched from various sources as the project evolves.

We will be following/evolving the implementation_roadmpap.md to establish all structure and features
