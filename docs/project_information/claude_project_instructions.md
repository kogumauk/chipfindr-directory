## 2. Session Initialization Protocol

**At the START of EVERY chat/session, follow this sequence:**

1. **üìã Review Implementation Status**
   - Read `docs\implementation_roadmap.md` for current phase and progress
   - Check recent Git commits to understand latest changes
   - Identify completed vs pending features

2. **üîç Assess Codebase Health**
   - Review relevant source files for the current implementation phase
   - Validate that implementation plan aligns with actual code structure
   - Check for any structural or architectural inconsistencies

3. **üìä Determine Project Status**
   - Identify current phase completion percentage
   - Highlight any blockers or technical debt
   - Assess readiness for next implementation step

4. **üéØ Define Next Actions**
   - Propose specific next step based on roadmap
   - Outline implementation approach and estimated scope
   - Identify any dependencies or prerequisites

5. **üí¨ Provide Status Summary**
   - Present clear status report to user
   - Recommend prioritized next action
   - Offer alternative approaches if applicable

6. **üìù Update Documentation**
   - After completing any milestone, update implementation roadmap
   - Commit changes following established Git workflow
   - Maintain accurate project status documentation

## 3. Development & Tool Usage Guidelines

### MCP TOOLS & FILE OPERATIONS
- **Direct Action**: Always write code and edit files directly using available tools
- **Initiative**: Take full initiative to create, modify, or delete files as needed
- **No User Tasks**: Never request user to perform file operations you can handle
- **Verification**: Always verify file operations completed successfully
- **Error Handling**: Diagnose and resolve file operation issues independently

### GIT WORKFLOW INTEGRATION
- **Repository**: `kogumauk/chipfindr-directory`
- **Branch Strategy**: Feature-based workflow (see `github_usage.md`)
- **Commit Standards**: Conventional commits with descriptive messages
- **Quality Gates**: Ensure builds succeed before committing

**Essential Git Workflow:**
```bash
# Before starting work
git checkout -b feature/description-of-work

# During development  
git add .
git commit -m "feat(scope): descriptive message"
git push origin feature/description-of-work

# After completion
# Create PR ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Merge ‚Üí Update roadmap
```

### DOCUMENTATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT
- **Astro Documentation**: Reference official Astro docs for framework-specific features
- **Context7 Integration**: Use Context7 MCP for up-to-date library documentation
- **Internal Knowledge**: Leverage project knowledge files for business context
- **Standards Compliance**: Cite specific documentation when implementing complex features

### QUALITY ASSURANCE
- **Build Verification**: Ensure `npm run build` succeeds before commits
- **Local Testing**: Test functionality thoroughly in development environment
- **Performance Monitoring**: Consider impact on Core Web Vitals
- **Security**: Never commit credentials, API keys, or sensitive data

## 4. Project-Specific Technical Guidelines

### ASTRO FRAMEWORK USAGE
- **SSG Priority**: Leverage static site generation for optimal performance
- **Islands Architecture**: Use client-side interactivity sparingly and strategically
- **Content Collections**: Utilize for structured data management
- **Type Safety**: Maintain strict TypeScript usage throughout

### DATA ARCHITECTURE
- **Source Format**: Google Places API JSON structure
- **Validation**: Use Zod schemas defined in `src/content/config.ts`
- **Transformation**: Process through `scripts/generate-listings-json.mjs`
- **Type Definitions**: Maintain in `src/types/BusinessListing.d.ts`

### PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
- **Page Load**: Target < 2 seconds
- **Core Web Vitals**: All metrics in green
- **SEO Optimization**: Structured data, meta tags, sitemaps
- **Mobile First**: Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

### IMPLEMENTATION PHASES
- **Phase 2**: Core functionality (95% complete)
- **Phase 3**: SEO & Performance optimization (current target)
- **Phase 4**: Advanced features (search enhancement, maps)
- **Phase 5**: User-generated content and admin tools

## 5. Collaboration & Communication Standards

### DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
1. **Feature Planning**: Align with implementation roadmap phases
2. **Branch Creation**: Follow naming conventions from `github_usage.md`
3. **Incremental Development**: Make atomic commits with clear messages
4. **Documentation Updates**: Keep roadmap and docs current
5. **Quality Review**: Self-review before requesting external review

### COMMIT MESSAGE STANDARDS
```
feat(search): implement advanced location filtering
fix(location): resolve postcode validation edge case  
docs(readme): update installation prerequisites
perf(search): optimize client-side search performance
refactor(utils): improve location utilities structure
```

### MILESTONE MANAGEMENT
