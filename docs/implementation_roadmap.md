# UK Business Directory Implementation Roadmap

## Project Overview
Building a modern, SEO-optimized UK business directory using Astro framework with Supabase backend integration.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Astro (SSG/SSR hybrid)
- **Backend**: Supabase (Storage, Auth, Functions, Hosting)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Modern CSS features
- **Search**: Algolia or Pagefind
- **Maps**: Mapbox GL JS
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics 4

---

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Data Architecture (Week 1-2)

### 1.1 Environment Setup
- [x] Initialize Astro project boilerplate
- [x] Configure TypeScript and ESLint
- [x] Set up Tailwind CSS with custom UK business theme
- [x] Configure Supabase project (Auth, Database, Storage)
- [x] Set up development/staging/production environments (initial .env setup)

### 1.2 Data Schema Design
```
// The authoritative TypeScript interfaces for business listings (BusinessListing, AddressComponent, Location, etc.)
// are now defined in `src/types/BusinessListing.d.ts`.
// Refer to that file for the detailed structure.
//
// Example (simplified for roadmap overview):
// interface BusinessListing {
//   id: string;
//   name: TypedText;
//   // ... other core fields
//   currentOpeningHours?: BusinessHours;
//   // ... etc.
// }
```

### 1.3 Content Collections Setup
- [x] Create Astro content collections for static data (schema defined in src/content/config.ts, types in src/types/BusinessListing.d.ts)
- [x] Design JSON import pipeline with data validation (for files like 'data/listings/*.json') - *Design complete, summary below*

### JSON Import and Validation Pipeline Design Summary

*   **Pipeline Summary:**
    *   **1. Initialization:** Prepare lists for valid/erroneous data, setup logging.
    *   **2. File Discovery & Iteration:** Scan `data/listings/*.json`, loop through files.
    *   **3. Per-File Processing:** Read, parse JSON, extract `metadata` and `results` array. Handle file/parse errors.
    *   **4. Listing Validation:** For each listing in `results`:
        *   Transform/map data to align with `businessListingSchema`.
        *   Validate against Zod schema (`businessListingSchema` from `src/content/config.ts`).
        *   Collect valid listings; log and collect details for erroneous listings.
    *   **5. Metadata Handling:** Log key `metadata` for context; associate with errors.
    *   **6. Finalization & Reporting:** Log overall summary, output `validListings` and `erroneousData` lists.
- [x] Implement data transformation scripts (see scripts/process-listings.mjs)
- [x] Set up automated data syncing between JSON files â†’ Supabase Database (implemented in scripts/sync-to-supabase.mjs; design in docs/supabase_sync_plan.md)
